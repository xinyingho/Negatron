/**
 * The list of axes available on a gamepad
 *
 * Thumbstick axis values range from SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MIN to
 * SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX, and are centered within ~8000 of zero, though
 * advanced UI will allow users to set or autodetect the dead zone, which
 * varies between gamepads.
 *
 * Trigger axis values range from 0 (released) to SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX (fully
 * pressed) when reported by SDL_GetGamepadAxis(). Note that this is not the
 * same range that will be reported by the lower-level SDL_GetJoystickAxis().
 *
 * \since This enum is available since SDL 3.1.3.
