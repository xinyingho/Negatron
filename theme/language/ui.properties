globalConf.lightgun=Light Gun
globalConf.lightgun.tooltip=Controls whether or not MAME makes use of lightgun controllers.\nNote that most lightguns map to the mouse, so using -lightgun and -mouse together may produce strange results.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.multikeyboard=Keyboards Differentiation
globalConf.multikeyboard.tooltip=Determines whether MAME differentiates between multiple keyboards.\nSome systems may report more than one keyboard; by default, the data from all of these keyboards is combined so that it looks like a single keyboard.\nTurning this option on will enable MAME to report keypresses on different keyboards independently.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.multimouse=Mice Differentiation
globalConf.multimouse.tooltip=Determines whether MAME differentiates between multiple mice.\nSome systems may report more than one mouse device; by default, the data from all of these mice is combined so that it looks like a single mouse.\nTurning this option on will enable MAME to report mouse movement and button presses on different mice independently.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.global_inputs=Global Inputs
globalConf.global_inputs.tooltip=Allow MAME to read inputs even when it doesn't have the focus.\nThe default is OFF.
#Coin Specific Options

globalConf.coin_lockout.tooltip=Enables simulation of the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoin lockout\u00e2\u0080\u009d feature that is implemented on a number of arcade game PCBs.\nIt was up to the operator whether or not the coin lockout outputs were actually connected to the coin mechanisms.\nIf this feature is enabled, then attempts to enter a coin while the lockout is active\nwill fail and will display a popup message in the user interface (In debug mode).\nIf this feature is disabled, the coin lockout signal will be ignored.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.coin_impulse=Coin Impulse
globalConf.coin_impulse.tooltip=Set coin impulse time based on n (n<0 disable impulse, n==0 obey driver, 0<n set time n).\nDefault is 0.\n\nCoin Impulse refers to the amount of time a coin active signal is presented for triggering a credit.\nDuty Cycle refers to the amount of time from one coin active signal to the next coin active signal.\nSome titles require specific conditions for credits to be accepted such as duty cycle & coin impulse.\nFor example:\n- Tetris Plus 2 Requires > 70 ms signal to reliably trigger a credit (50 ms will cause credit instability),\n- Williams Titles (Defender, Joust etc.) require > 500 ms duty cycle for each credit to be accepted.\nExample usage:\n- Title refresh = 60 Hz\n- Coin impulse = 6\n1 \u00c3\u00b7 60 = 0.0166666'\n0.0166666' \u00c3\u0097 6 = 0.1 seconds (Or 100 ms)\nSetting the coin impulse to 6 on a 60 Hz title presents a 100 ms signal for triggering a credit.
#Light Gun Specific Options
lightGunSpecificOptions=Light Gun Specific Options
globalConf.offscreen_reload=2nd Button As Offscreen Reload
globalConf.offscreen_reload.tooltip=Controls whether or not MAME treats a second button input from a lightgun as a reload signal.\nIn this case, MAME will report the gun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position as (0,MAX) with the trigger held,\nwhich is equivalent to an offscreen reload.\nThis is only needed for games that required you to shoot offscreen to reload,\nand then only if your gun does not support off screen reloads.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.dual_lightgun=Dual Light Gun
globalConf.dual_lightgun.tooltip=Controls whether or not MAME attempts to track two lightguns connected at the same time.\nThis option requires -lightgun. This option is a hack for supporting certain older dual lightgun setups.\nIf you have multiple lightguns connected, you will probably just need to enable -mouse\nand configure each lightgun independently.\nThe default is OFF.
#Keyboard Specific Options
keyboardSpecificOptions=Keyboard Specific Options
globalConf.steadykey=Steady Key
globalConf.steadykey.tooltip=Some systems require two or more buttons to be pressed at exactly the same time to make special moves.\nDue to limitations in the keyboard hardware, it can be difficult or even impossible to accomplish that\nusing the standard keyboard handling.\nThis option selects a different handling that makes it easier to register simultaneous button presses,\nbut has the disadvantage of making controls less responsive.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.ui_active=UI Active
globalConf.ui_active.tooltip=Enable user interface on top of emulated keyboard (if present).\nThe key Scroll Lock on Windows and Linux or Delete on macOS allows users to disable and enable the emulated keyboard in machines that require it.\nAll emulations which require emulated keyboards will start in that mode and you can only access the internal UI (hitting TAB) by first hitting this key.\nYou can change the initial status of the emulated keyboard as presented upon start by using -ui_active.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.natural=Natural
globalConf.natural.tooltip=Allows user to specify whether or not to use a natural keyboard or not.\nThis allows you to start your system in a \u00e2\u0080\u0098native\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mode, depending on your region, allowing compatability for non-\u00e2\u0080\u009cQWERTY\u00e2\u0080\u009d style keyboards.\nThe default is OFF.\n\nIn \u00e2\u0080\u009cemulated keyboard\u00e2\u0080\u009d mode (the default mode), MAME translates pressing/releasing host keys/buttons to emulated keystrokes.\nWhen you press/release a key/button mapped to an emulated key, MAME presses/releases the emulated key.\n\nIn \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural keyboard\u00e2\u0080\u009d mode, MAME attempts to translate characters to keystrokes.\nThe OS translates keystrokes to characters (similarly when you type into a text editor), and MAME attempts to translate these characters to emulated keystrokes.\n\nThere are a number of unavoidable limitations in \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural keyboard\u00e2\u0080\u009d mode:\n- The emulated system driver and/or keyboard device or has to support it.\n- The selected keyboard must match the keyboard layout selected in the emulated OS!\n- Keystrokes that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce characters can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be translated. (e.g. pressing a modifier on its own such as shift, ctrl, or alt)\n- Holding a key until the character repeats will cause the emulated key to be pressed repeatedly as opposed to being held down.\n- Dead key sequences are cumbersome to use at best.\n- It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work at all if IME edit is involved. (e.g. for Chinese/Japanese/Korean)

globalConf.joystick_saturation.tooltip=If you play with an analog joystick, the ends can drift a little,\nand may not match in the +/- directions.\njoystick_saturation tells how far along an axis movement change\nwill be accepted before it reaches the maximum range.\nThis option expects a float in the range of 0.0 to 1.0,\nwhere 0 is the center of the joystick and 1 is the outer limit.\nThe default is 0.85.
globalConf.joystick_contradictory=Contradictory
globalConf.joystick_contradictory.tooltip=Enable contradictory direction digital joystick input at the same time\nsuch as Left and Right or Up and Down at the same time.\nThe default is OFF.
#Screen Options
screenOptions=Screen Options
globalConf.brightness=Brightness
globalConf.brightness.tooltip=Controls the default brightness, or black level, of the system screens.\nThis option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display.\nUsing the MAME UI, you can individually set the brightness for each system screen;\nthis option controls the initial value for all visible system screens.\nThe standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a darkened display,\nwhile selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a brighter display.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.contrast=Contrast
globalConf.contrast.tooltip=Controls the contrast, or white level, of the system screens.\nThis option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display.\nUsing the MAME UI, you can individually set the contrast for each system screen;\nthis option controls the initial value for all visible system screens.\nThe standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a dimmer display,\nwhile selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a more saturated display.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.gamma=Gamma
globalConf.gamma.tooltip=Controls the gamma, which produces a potentially nonlinear black to white ramp, for the system screens.\nThis option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display.\nUsing the MAME UI, you can individually set the gamma for each system screen;\nthis option controls the initial value for all visible system screens.\nThe standard value is 1.0, which gives a linear ramp from black to white.\nSelecting lower values (down to 0.1) will increase the nonlinearity toward black,\nwhile selecting higher values (up to 3.0) will push the nonlinearity toward white.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.pause_brightness=Pause Brightness
globalConf.pause_brightness.tooltip=This controls the brightness level when MAME is paused.\nThe default value is 0.65.
#Performance Options
performanceOptions=Performance Options
globalConf.autoframeskip=Auto Frame Skipping
globalConf.autoframeskip.tooltip=Automatically determines the frameskip level while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running the system,\nadjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to keep the system running at full speed.\nTurning this on overrides the value you have set for -frameskip below.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.frameskip=Frame Skip
globalConf.frameskip.tooltip=Specifies the frameskip value. This is the number of frames out of every 12 to drop when running.\nFor example, if you say -frameskip 2, then MAME will display 10 out of every 12 frames.\nBy skipping those frames, you may be able to get full speed in a system that requires more horsepower than your computer has.\nThe default value is -frameskip 0, which skips no frames.
globalConf.throttle=Throttle
globalConf.throttle.tooltip=Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on,\nMAME attempts to keep the system running at the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intended speed.\nWhen throttling is off, MAME runs the system as fast as it can.\nNote that the fastest speed is more often than not limited by your graphics card, especially for older systems.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.sleep=Sleep
globalConf.sleep.tooltip=Allows MAME to give time back to the system when running with -throttle.\nThis allows other programs to have some CPU time, assuming that the system isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taxing 100% of your CPU resources.\nThis option can potentially cause hiccups in performance if other demanding programs are running.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.speed=Speed
globalConf.speed.tooltip=Changes the way MAME throttles the emulated system such that it runs at some multiplier of the original speed.\nA <factor> of 1.0 means to run the system at its normal speed.\nA <factor> of 0.5 means run at half speed, and a <factor> of 2.0 means run at 2x speed.\nNote that changing this value affects sound playback as well, which will scale in pitch accordingly.\nThe internal resolution of the fraction is two decimalplaces, so a value of 1.002 is the same as 1.0.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.refreshspeed=Refresh Speed
globalConf.refreshspeed.tooltip=Allows MAME to dynamically adjust the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speed such that it does not exceed\nthe slowest refresh rate for any targeted monitors in your system.\nThus, if you have a 60Hz monitor and run a system that is actually designed to run at 60.6Hz,\nMAME will dynamically change the speed down to 99% in order to prevent sound hiccups\nor other undesirable side effects of running at a slower refresh rate.\nThe default is OFF.
#Rendering Options
renderingOptions=Rendering Options
globalConf.keepaspect=Original Aspect Ratio
globalConf.keepaspect.tooltip=Enables aspect ratio enforcement.\nWhen this option is on, the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proper aspect ratio (generally 4:3 or 3:4) is enforced,\nso you get the system looking like it should.\nWhen running in a window with this option on, you can only resize the window to\nthe proper aspect ratio, unless you are holding down the CONTROL key.\nBy turning the option off, the aspect ratio is allowed to float.\nIn full screen mode, this means that all systems will stretch to the full screen size (even vertical systems).\nIn window mode, it means that you can freely resize the window without any constraints.\nThe default is ON.\n\nThe MAME team heavily suggests you leave this at default.\nStretching systems beyond their original aspect ratio will mangle the appearance of the system in ways\nthat no filtering or HLSL can repair.
globalConf.unevenstretch=Uneven Stretch
globalConf.unevenstretch.tooltip=Allow non-integer stretch factors allowing for great window sizing flexibility.\nVideo purists should stay far, far away from this option,\nwhile everyone else will be happy to know that it lets you fill the screen properly in full-screen mode.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.unevenstretchx=Uneven Stretch X
globalConf.unevenstretchx.tooltip=This option is the same as -unevenstretch but only affect the screen size horizontally.
globalConf.unevenstretchy=Uneven Stretch Y
globalConf.unevenstretchy.tooltip=This option is the same as -unevenstretch but only affect the screen size vertically.
globalConf.autostretchxy=Auto Uneven Stretch
globalConf.autostretchxy.tooltip=Automatically apply -unevenstretchx or -unevenstretchy based on source native orientation.
globalConf.intoverscan=Overscan
globalConf.intoverscan.tooltip=This option adds overscan to a screen when using integer scaling.\nOverscan is the part of a systems screen output which is generated outside the visible edge of a monitor.
globalConf.intscalex=Integer Scale X
globalConf.intscalex.tooltip=This option allows you to change the horizontal scaling of a systems screen output.\nThe value that you add to the command determines the scaling factor.\nThe default is 0 (auto).
globalConf.intscaley=Integer Scale Y
globalConf.intscaley.tooltip=This option allows you to change the vertical scaling of a systems screen output.\nThe value that you add to the command determines the scaling factor.\nThe default is 0 (auto).
#Rotation Options
rotationOptions=Rotation Options
globalConf.rotate=Auto Rotate
globalConf.rotate.tooltip=Rotate the system to match its normal state (horizontal/vertical).\nThis ensures that both vertically and horizontally oriented systems show up correctly without the need to rotate your monitor.\nIf you want to keep the system displaying \u00e2\u0080\u0098raw\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on the screen the way it would have in the arcade, turn this option OFF.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.ror=Rotate Right
globalConf.ror.tooltip=Rotate the system screen to the right (clockwise) or left (counter-clockwise)\nrelative to either its normal state (if -rotate is specified) or its native state (if -norotate is specified).\nThe default for both of these options is OFF.
globalConf.rol=Rotate Left
globalConf.rol.tooltip=Rotate the system screen to the right (clockwise) or left (counter-clockwise)\nrelative to either its normal state (if -rotate is specified) or its native state (if -norotate is specified).\nThe default for both of these options is OFF.
globalConf.autoror=Auto Rotate Right
globalConf.autoror.tooltip=These options are designed for use with pivoting screens that only pivot in a single direction.\nIf your screen only pivots clockwise, use -autorol to ensure that the system will fill the screen\neither horizontally or vertically in one of the directions you can handle.\nIf your screen only pivots counter-clockwise, use -autoror.
globalConf.autorol=Auto Rotate Left
globalConf.autorol.tooltip=These options are designed for use with pivoting screens that only pivot in a single direction.\nIf your screen only pivots clockwise, use -autorol to ensure that the system will fill the screen\neither horizontally or vertically in one of the directions you can handle.\nIf your screen only pivots counter-clockwise, use -autoror.
globalConf.flipx=Flip X
globalConf.flipx.tooltip=Flip (mirror) the system screen either horizontally (-flipx) or vertically (-flipy).\nThe flips are applied after the -rotate and -ror/-rol options are applied.\nThe default for both of these options is OFF.
globalConf.flipy=Flip Y
globalConf.flipy.tooltip=Flip (mirror) the system screen either horizontally (-flipx) or vertically (-flipy).\nThe flips are applied after the -rotate and -ror/-rol options are applied.\nThe default for both of these options is OFF.
#Artwork Options
artworkOptions=Artwork Options
globalConf.artwork_crop=Artwork Cropping
globalConf.artwork_crop.tooltip=Enable cropping of artwork to the system screen area only.\nThis works best with -video gdi or -video d3d, and means that vertically oriented systems\nrunning full screen can display their artwork to the left and right sides of the screen.\nThis option can also be controlled via the Video Options menu in the user interface.\nThe default is OFF.

globalConf.use_marquees.tooltip=Enables/disables the display of marquees.\nThe default is ON.
#Vector Options
vectorOptions=Vector Options
globalConf.beam_width_min=Min Beam Width
globalConf.beam_width_min.tooltip=Sets the minimum and maximum width of the vectors.\nThis is a scaling factor against the standard vector width,\nwhich is interpolated between minimum and maximum according to the beam's intensity.\nA value of 1.0 will keep the default vector line width.\nSmaller values will reduce the width, and larger values will increase the width.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.beam_width_max=Max Beam Width
globalConf.beam_width_max.tooltip=Sets the minimum and maximum width of the vectors.\nThis is a scaling factor against the standard vector width,\nwhich is interpolated between minimum and maximum according to the beam's intensity.\nA value of 1.0 will keep the default vector line width.\nSmaller values will reduce the width, and larger values will increase the width.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.beam_intensity_weight=Beam Intensity Weight

output.auto=Auto
output.none=None
output.console=Console
output.network=Network
osdSoundOptions=OS Dependent Sound Options
globalConf.sound=Sound
globalConf.sound.tooltip=Specifies which sound subsystem to use. Selecting none disables sound output altogether (sound\nhardware is still emulated).\n\nOn Windows, dsound, xaudio2, portaudio and none are available.\nOn macOS, coreaudio, sdl, portaudio and none are available.\nOn other operating systems, sdl, portaudio and none are available. (Special build options\nallow sdl to be used on Windows, or portaudio to be disabled.)\n\nThe default is dsound on Windows. On Mac, coreaudio is the default. On all other platforms,\nsdl is the default.\n\nOn Windows and Linux, portaudio is likely to give the lowest possible latency, while Mac users\nwill find coreaudio provides the best results.\n\nWhen using the sdl sound subsystem, the audio API to use may be selected by setting the\nSDL_AUDIODRIVER environment variable. Available audio APIs depend on the operating\nsystem. On Windows, it may be necessary to set SDL_AUDIODRIVER=directsound if no sound output\nis produced by default.
sound.auto=Auto
sound.none=None
sound.dsound=DirectSound
sound.coreaudio=Core Audio
sound.sdl=SDL
sound.xaudio2=XAudio2
sound.portaudio=PortAudio
globalConf.audio_latency=Audio Latency
globalConf.audio_latency.tooltip=The exact behavior depends on the selected audio output module. Smaller values provide less\naudio delay while requiring better system performance. Higher values increase audio delay but\nmay help avoid buffer under-runs and audio interruptions.\n\nThe default is 2.
#OSD Options 2
osdVideoOptions=OS Dependent Video Options
globalConf.uifontprovider=UI Font Provider
globalConf.uifontprovider.tooltip=Chooses a provider for UI font rendering.\n\nOn Windows, you can choose from: win, dwrite, none or auto.\nOn macOS, you can choose from: osx, none or auto.\nOn other platforms, you can choose from: sdl, none or auto.\n\nDefault setting is auto.

uifontprovider.osx=OSX
globalConf.video=Video
globalConf.video.tooltip=Specifies which video subsystem to use for drawing. Options here depend on the operating\nsystem and whether this is an SDL-compiled version of MAME.\n\nGenerally Available:\nUsing bgfx specifies the new hardware accelerated renderer.\nUsing opengl tells MAME to render video using OpenGL acceleration.\nUsing none displays no windows and does no drawing. This is primarily present for doing\nCPU benchmarks without the overhead of the video system.\n\nOn Windows:\nUsing gdi tells MAME to render video using older standard Windows graphics drawing\ncalls. This is the slowest but most compatible option on older versions of Windows.\nUsing d3d tells MAME to use Direct3D for rendering. This produces the better quality\noutput than gdi and enables additional rendering options. It is recommended if you have\na semi-recent (2002+) video card or onboard Intel video of the HD3000 line or better.\n\nOn other platforms (including SDL on Windows):\nUsing accel tells MAME to render video using SDL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2D acceleration if possible.\nUsing soft uses software rendering for video output. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as fast or as nice as\nOpenGL but will work on any platform.\n\nDefaults:\nThe default on Windows is d3d.\nThe default for Mac OS X is opengl because OS X is guaranteed to have a compliant\nOpenGL stack.\nThe default on all other systems is soft.
video.auto=Auto

video.gdi=GDI
video.d3d=Direct3D
video.opengl=OpenGL
video.soft=Software Rendering
video.accel=2D Acceleration
video.none=None
globalConf.numscreens=Number of Screens
globalConf.numscreens.tooltip=Tells MAME how many output windows to create. For most systems, a single output window is all\nyou need, but some systems originally used multipl screens (e.g. Darius and PlayChoice-10\narcade machines). Each screen (up to 4) has its own independent settings for physical monitor,\naspect ratio, resolution, and view, which can be set using the options below.\n\nThe default is 1.
globalConf.window=Run In A Window
globalConf.window.tooltip=Run MAME in either a window or full screen.\nThe default is OFF (-nowindow).
globalConf.maximize=Maximised Window
globalConf.maximize.tooltip=Controls initial window size in windowed mode. If it is set on, the window will initially be set to\nthe maximum supported size when you start MAME. If it is turned off, the window will start out\nat the closest possible size to the original size of the display; it will scale on only one axis where\nnon-square pixels are used. This option only has an effect when the -window option is used.\n\nThe default is ON (-maximize).
globalConf.switchres=Full Screen Resolution Switching
globalConf.switchres.tooltip=Enables resolution switching. This option is required for the -resolution* options to switch\nresolutions in full screen mode.\n\nOn modern video cards, there is little reason to switch resolutions unless you are trying to\nachieve the \u00e2\u0080\u009cexact\u00e2\u0080\u009d pixel resolutions of the original systems, which requires significant tweaking.\nThis option is also useful on LCD displays, since they run with a fixed resolution and switching\nresolutions on them is just silly. This option does not work with -video gdi.\n\nThe default is OFF (-noswitchres).
globalConf.full_screen_brightness=Full Screen Brightness
globalConf.full_screen_brightness.tooltip=Controls the brightness, or black level, of the entire display. The standard value is 1.0. Selecting\nlower values (down to 0.1) will produce a darkened display, while selecting higher values (up to\n2.0) will give a brighter display. Note that not all video cards have hardware to support this\noption. This option does not work with -video gdi. The default is 1.0.
globalConf.full_screen_contrast=Full Screen Contrast
globalConf.full_screen_contrast.tooltip=Controls the contrast, or white level, of the entire display. The standard value is 1.0. Selecting\nlower values (down to 0.1) will produce a dimmer display, while selecting higher values (up to 2.0)\nwill give a more saturated display. Note that not all video cards have hardware to support this\noption. This option does not work with -video gdi. The default is 1.0.
globalConf.full_screen_gamma=Full Screen Gamma
globalConf.full_screen_gamma.tooltip=Controls the gamma, which produces a potentially nonlinear black to white ramp, for the entire\ndisplay. The standard value is 1.0, which gives a linear ramp from black to white. Selecting lower\nvalues (down to 0.1) will increase the nonlinearity toward black, while selecting higher values (up\nto 3.0) will push the nonlinearity toward white. Note that not all video cards have hardware to\nsupport this option. This option does not work with -video gdi. The default is 1.0.
globalConf.syncrefresh=Sync Refresh
globalConf.syncrefresh.tooltip=Enables speed throttling only to the refresh of your monitor. This means that the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual\nrefresh rate is ignored; however, the sound code still attempts to keep up with the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\noriginal refresh rate, so you may encounter sound problems.\n\nThis option is intended mainly for those who have tweaked their video card\u00e2\u0080\u0099s settings to provide\ncarefully matched refresh rate options. Note that this option does not work with -video gdi mode.\n\nThe default is OFF (-nosyncrefresh).
globalConf.monitorprovider=Monitor Provider
globalConf.monitorprovider.tooltip=Defines the monitor discovery method.\n\nOn Windows, you can choose from: auto, dxgi, win32, or none\nOn SDL, you can choose from: auto, sdl, or none\n\nThe default is auto.\n\nOn Windows 8+, auto will try dxgi with fallback to win32. On any other Windows, it defaults to win32.\nOn SDL (macOS and Linux), auto will default to sdl.
monitorprovider.auto=Auto
monitorprovider.none=None
monitorprovider.dxgi=DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI)
monitorprovider.win32=Win32
monitorprovider.sdl=SDL
osdAcceleratedVideoOptions=OS Dependent Accelerated Video Options
globalConf.filter=Filter
globalConf.filter.tooltip=Enable bilinear filtering on the system screen graphics. When disabled, point filtering is applied,\nwhich is crisper but leads to scaling artifacts. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the filtered look, you are probably\nbetter off increasing the -prescale value rather than turning off filtering altogether.\n\nThe default is ON (-filter).\n\nThis is supported with OpenGL and D3D video on Windows and is ONLY supported with OpenGL\non other platforms.\n\nUse bgfx_screen_chains in your INI file(s) to adjust filtering with the BGFX video system.
globalConf.prescale=Prescale
globalConf.prescale.tooltip=Controls the size of the screen images when they are passed off to the graphics system for\nscaling. At the minimum setting of 1, the screen is rendered at its original resolution before being\nscaled. At higher settings, the screen is expanded in both axes by a factor of <amount> using\nnearest-neighbor sampling before applying filters or shaders. With -video d3d, this produces a\nless blurry image at the expense of speed.\n\nThe default is 1.\n\nThis is supported with all video output types (bgfx, d3d, etc) on Windows and is ONLY\nsupported with OpenGL on other platforms.
